# üß† Atlas Litepaper

## Overview
Atlas is a decentralized AI agent protocol designed for autonomous coordination across Web3 systems. It enables long-lived, context-aware agents that remember, reason, and act ‚Äî powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and secured with Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs).

As blockchain infrastructure scales, the need for intelligent agents capable of adapting to evolving environments becomes crucial. Atlas introduces a modular, privacy-preserving intelligence layer for smart contracts, wallets, and dApps.

## Core Components

### üß© Model Context Protocol (MCP)
MCP provides memory and context retention for agents. It structures data across time into queryable capsules that fuel decision-making, enable behavioral memory, and allow agents to improve continuously.

### üîê Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)
Agents operate inside TEEs for verifiable, tamper-proof computation. All sensitive logic ‚Äî including memory evaluation, task execution, and agent policy ‚Äî remains private and cryptographically secure.

### üõ† Atlas Framework
The orchestration layer that connects agents to the network. Includes:
- API access for developers
- Agent identity and coordination
- Cross-agent communication and task routing

## Agent Architecture

Atlas features a modular multi-agent system. Each agent is purpose-built, but interoperable:

### üõ° Sentinel Agent
Detects wallet anomalies, monitors contracts, enforces real-time risk policies.

### üí∞ Vault Agent
Manages treasury strategy, asset routing, and transaction security.

### üîç Scout Agent
Surfaces new token events, wallet behaviors, and opportunity scans.

### üì¢ Echo Agent
Analyzes sentiment and narrative shifts across social platforms.

### üîó Relay Agent
Handles encrypted messaging between agents, dApps, and users.

### üìö Synth Agent
Constructs data graphs from multi-source inputs to inform decisions.

All agents are powered by **Context Capsules** ‚Äî encrypted memory containers that persist across chains and interfaces.

## Demonstration: Samurai Adventure

Atlas is showcased through **Samurai Adventure**, a real-time simulation where all enemies and interactions are driven by live Atlas agents.

Players experience agents adapting based on learned memory and shifting strategies. The game functions as both a demo and live testbed for Atlas architecture.

## Developer Tooling

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Beta Notice:** Atlas API is currently in beta and available to selected developers. To request access, please email **beta@atlaslab.io**.

Atlas offers a Python-based SDK and REST API with the following features:
- Register and manage agents
- Trigger tasks via API or CLI
- Monitor memory and behavior logs

### Example Install:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/AtlasLabAI/atlas-api.git
```

### Quickstart:
```python
from atlas import Atlas
api = Atlas(api_key="your_api_key")
response = api.call_endpoint(text="Track SOL market.")
print(response.data)
```
